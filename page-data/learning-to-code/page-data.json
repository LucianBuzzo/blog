Instead of focusing on a specific language or technology, I suggest a more goal-oriented approach. Here are some key insights to guide you on your coding journey.</p>\n<h3>Focus on a Project:</h3>\n<p>When starting out, it’s important to choose a project that has value to others, is something you care about, and has clear milestones and an end goal. This allows you to concentrate on solving problems and moving towards your objective, rather than feeling overwhelmed by the vast array of languages, frameworks, and libraries. Working towards a tangible goal incentivizes learning and information retention.\nIf you’re unsure of a project idea, leverage your existing expertise or delve into topics you’d like to know more about. This not only serves as a portfolio piece when applying for jobs, but it could also become a passive income source.</p>\n<h3>Establish Good Working Practices:</h3>\n<p>From the beginning, create a simple specification document outlining your project and its high-level workings. Familiarize yourself with git, branches, and regular commits with clear messages. Push your code to GitHub and learn how to use pull requests to update your codebase. Start writing automated tests and setting up a CI/CD pipeline. These practices will benefit you in the long run.</p>\n<h3>Work in the Open:</h3>\n<p>Make your work public on GitHub and discuss it on social media to increase your exposure. Your project’s README should be the specification document, and someone unfamiliar with your project should be able to understand it from your GitHub repo or landing page. Having your work visible to others encourages adherence to good working practices and provides opportunities for valuable feedback.</p>\n<h3>Embrace Failure and Keep Learning:</h3>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to fail; it’s an expected part of progress. It can be daunting to start something new, but taking one step at a time will help you move forward. Even if your initial ideas don’t work out, look for lessons to learn and try again.</p>\n<p>Remember, everything seems scary when it’s new. Don’t hesitate to dive in headfirst, as most things are simpler than they appear from the outside. Good luck on your coding journey!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to Start Coding: A Practical Guide","date":"May 01, 2023"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/learning-to-code/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/lazy-engineers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Are Good Engineers Lazy?"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
